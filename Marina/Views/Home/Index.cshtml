            <h1>Welcome to Marina</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                Welcome to Inland Marina located on the south shore Inland Lake, just a small commute from major
                centers in the southwest.
                <br />
                <br />
                Inland Marina was established in the 1967 shortly after Inland Lake was created as a result of the
                Southwest dam. From its humble beginnings, it has grown to be the largest marina on Inland Lake. Due
                to the warm climate that extends year-round, Inland Lake has become a popular tourist destination in
                the southwest. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Boat owners from California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah are attracted to the area.
                Inland Marina has 90 slips ranging in size from 16 to 32 feet in length. Dock services include electrical
                and fresh water.
